# Brain-Computer-Interface-Controller-
This project was aimed at classifying motor imagery from EEG data using machine learning to play a game like pong. 
It is an asynchronous controller and outputs a motor imagery scale continuously. 
This allows the user to perform an action at will and is not time-locked.
